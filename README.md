# 📊 Elevate Labs – Data Analyst Internship (Task 5)

## 📝 Task 5: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### 🎯 Objective
To perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on a dataset (Titanic dataset or another relevant dataset), uncover patterns, relationships, and anomalies, and summarize insights using **statistical exploration and data visualization**.  

---

## 🛠 Tools Used
- 🐍 Python  
- 📦 Libraries: **Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn**  
- 📂 Dataset: Titanic Dataset (or chosen alternative)  

---

## 🗂 Steps Performed

### 🔹 Data Understanding
- Loaded dataset into Pandas DataFrame.  
- Used `.info()`, `.describe()`, `.head()` to understand structure and summary statistics.  
- Checked missing values and data types.  

### 🔹 Univariate Analysis
- Used **histograms** and **count plots** to analyze distributions of single variables (e.g., Age, Fare, Survived).  
- Observed skewness and potential outliers.  

### 🔹 Bivariate Analysis
- Used **boxplots** and **violin plots** to study survival by gender/class.  
- Created **scatterplots** to examine relationships between numerical variables (e.g., Age vs. Fare).  

### 🔹 Multivariate Analysis
- Created **pairplots** (`sns.pairplot()`) to check relationships across multiple features.  
- Used **heatmaps** (`sns.heatmap()`) to study correlations between numerical features.  

### 🔹 Key Visualizations
- 📊 Histograms – Age & Fare distributions  
- 📦 Boxplots – Outlier detection (e.g., Fare outliers)  
- 👥 Countplots – Survival by Gender/Class  
- 🔥 Heatmap – Correlation between numerical variables  
- 🔄 Pairplot – Overall feature interactions  

### 🔹 Observations
- Female passengers had a higher survival rate than males.  
- Higher-class passengers (1st Class) had higher survival chances.  
- Age distribution was right-skewed with some extreme values.  
- Strong positive correlation found between **Fare** and **Class**.  
- Family size features (SibSp, Parch) showed weak correlation with survival.  

---


## ✅ Outcome
- Learned how to apply **EDA techniques** using Python.  
- Gained experience in **visualizing data** and interpreting trends.  
- Built confidence in **finding meaningful insights** before modeling.  
- Understood **patterns in the Titanic dataset** that affect survival.
